I finally got around to posting some old phones to ebay.  Go check them out if you are interested.

# iPhone 3G

This is my well used iPhone 3G given to me by my sister.  It was my first smartphone, and pretty much drove me crazy because it was so slow.  It would be a good gift to a kid who wanted an iPhone to play with:

# iPhone 3GS

I bought this from a friend, then shortly later was gifted a used iPhone 4.  I never got to use it that much, but hey, if you are looking for a 3GS give it a shot!

# HTC Aria

This was Elena's old Android.  It was slow and far to tiney to type on well.  Plus, well, Android sucked at this point still.  It's rooted and is running Cyanogen mod.
