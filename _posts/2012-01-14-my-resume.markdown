[My resume](/assets/resume/Bret_Comnes_CV_Public.pdf) is directly based off of [Todd. C. Miller's template](http://www.gratisoft.us/todd/resume.html), which was based off of [David J. Grant's work](http://www.davidgrant.ca/latex_resume_template), which is supposedly based off of Matthew Boedicker's work, which I never located.  David's work eventually stemmed off into its own [CTAN package](http://tug.ctan.org/pkg/tucv), by [George Louthan](http://www.georgelouthan.com/), which looked nice, but turned out to be not as flexible as I hoped, so I have yet to make use of it. I might revisit it in the future when I have time, but I am happy with what I have now.

I subsequently messed with the margins, added the black boarder to the topic boxes, and added a simple footer with the page number and date the resume was generated.  If you are interested in any of the modifications, they are [available](https://github.com/bcomnes/Resume) on my [github](https://github.com/bcomnes) page.

I happened to stumble across an article on [AstroBetter](http://www.astrobetter.com/how-and-why-to-use-textmate-for-latex/) the other day, basically describing the working environment that I use for writing TeX documents.  I'll post more about what I do eventually, but if you are getting started writing LaTeX on the mac, that post has a decent rundown similar to what I use.
